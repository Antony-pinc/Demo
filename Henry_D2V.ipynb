Brain Health Strategies  1 message      Brandi Becker-Wright <bwright@alz.org>  Thu, Mar 23, 2023 at 10:26 AM  To: zbad55@yahoo.com    Hi Mr. and Mrs. Ravezzani,    This is Brandi, the social worker you met with on video yesterday along with Dr. Novikova.  I've attached here the document that goes along with the brain health strategies that we discussed.  As we talked about, the more you are able to implement these things into your regular routine, the better you will be supporting your brain, keeping it healthy, and delaying further decline - no matter the cause or reason for the memory loss.    I'm sorry that yesterday was such a difficult day.  But please know that we are here to support you in any way that we can, at each step of the journey.     All of my contact information can be found below in my signature line if you should need to reach out.  Please don't hesitate!

The patient does not require additional consultation with any other provider at this time.      Dear Dr. North, Wayne Trevor, MD,     Thank you for asking us to see Laura Chaluleu for a consultation to be evaluated by the Optimization Clinic for risk assessment and to look for opportunities for optimization for the upcoming surgery or procedure.  Our findings are noted below.  All findings were discussed with the patient and educational handouts were given when appropriate.      All questions were answered to his satisfaction.     Summary of Preoperative Assessment and Recommendations:   The patient is scheduled to undergo a moderate risk procedure or surgery.     We discussed the additional risk of surgical intervention due to the patient's known cardiac disease, smoker.     Other pertinent risk factors for this patient include:  None      The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) was performed.     The DASI score is 15.45   The patient is able to obtain greater than 4 METs of activity.    The answers are self-reported by the patient.     The higher the score is (maximum 58.2), the more physically active a person is according to the set of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) measured by this index.            The ASA Physical Status Classification was performed.     The patient is an ASA 3, and functionally is not dependent.  ;    [] ASA I, a normal healthy patient        [] ASA II, a patient with mild systemic disease   [x] ASA III, a patient with severe systemic disease   [] ASA IV, a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life   [] ASA V,  a moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation      Cardiac risk:     GUPTA   0.6 %  Risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest, intraoperatively or up to 30 days post-op   The risk of cardiac complications for this patient is Low due to hypertension and smoking   Cardiac tests performed as noted: electrocardiogram and Echo   Cardiac Risk Reduction Strategies:    The patient was instructed about having exercise as tolerated and take healthy diet.     Additionally, patient was encouraged to go to Cardiac Rehab.       Antiplatelet management instructions: Not taking     NSQIP Surgical Risk Assessment:   Unavailable, GUPTA score used     Pulmonary Risk:  Refer to the NSQIP.     The risk of pulmonary complications for this patient is Low due to severe sleep apnea   The STOP BANG Score is: not performed, Patient already on CPAP for her OSA.     Pulmonary Risk Reduction Strategies:      A STOP BANG score of less than 3 is generally considered a low risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).     A score of 3 or greater is generally considered a high risk of OSA.  If STOP BANG Score is greater than 5 then patient will be referred to Sleep Medicine for evaluation of OSA prior to the surgery/procedure, if time permits.     The patient was counseled on use of incentive spirometer post operatively - Yes.    Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Risk:     The Caprini score is used to estimate the risk of  venous thromboembolism in general surgery patients.     The patient is at a  high risk as evidenced by the Caprini score of: >5 .  (VTE) Risk Reduction Strategies:     The patient was counseled on the importance of early mobility post-surgery/procedure -  ; Yes.    RISK OF DELIRIUM:     The risk of post-operative delirium and/or cognitive decline for the  patient is below average.     The risks are  No risk factors for confusion.     Mini-Cog Assessment Score:   not performed   (0 recall = + dementia, 1-2 recall with abnormal clock draw = + for dementia, 1-3 recall & normal clock draw = neg. dementia screen)  Recommendations to minimize risk of delirium:     Attempt to maintain circadian rhythm (keep the shades up during the day & minimize interruptions at night), ensure patient has their hearing aids and glasses if they use them, frequent reorientation, encourage early ambulation, discontinue foley catheter as soon as possible, avoid sleeping aids & unnecessary anticholinergic medications, maintain euvolemia, avoid constipation, ensure adequate pain control & involve the family.

The patient's tolerance of previous                          anesthesia was also reviewed. The risks and benefits                          of the procedure and the sedation options and risks                          were discussed with the patient. All questions were                          answered, and informed consent was obtained. Prior                          Anticoagulants: The patient has taken no anticoagulant                          or antiplatelet agents. ASA Grade Assessment: III - A                          patient with severe systemic disease. After reviewing                          the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in                          satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure.                         After I obtained informed consent, the scope was                          passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure,                  ;          the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen                          saturations were monitored continuously. The                          Colonoscope was introduced through the anus and                          advanced to the terminal ileum. The colonoscopy was                          performed without difficulty. The patient tolerated                          the procedure well. The quality of the bowel                          preparation was good.                                                                                   Estimated Blood Loss:       Estimated blood loss was minimal.  Findings:       Two sessile polyps were found in the ascending colon. The polyps were 12        to 18 mm in size. Area was successfully injected with solution of dilute        epinephrine and methylene blue for a lift polypectomy. These polyps were        removed with a piecemeal technique using a cold snare. Resection and        retrieval were complete.       A 5 mm polyp was found in the ascending colon. The polyp was sessile.        The polyp was removed with a cold snare. Resection and retrieval were        complete.       Non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids were found. The hemorrhoids were small.       The exam was otherwise without abnormality.                                                                                   Impression:            - Two 12 to 18 mm polyps in the ascending colon                          removed by endoscopic mucosal resection with lift and                          piecemeal cold snare. Resected and retrieved.                         - One 5 mm polyp in the ascending colon, removed with                          a cold snare. Resected and retrieved.                         - Non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids.                         - The examination was otherwise normal.                                                                                   Recommendation:        -  ; Discharge patient to home.                         - High fiber diet.                         - Await pathology results.                         - Repeat colonoscopy for surveillance based on                          pathology results. Likely 6 months due to piecemeal                          resection.

Problem List - A&P Notes:              1) Acute renal failure superimposed on stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CMS-hcc) (ICD-10: N17.9)  -P/w creatinine at 2.06, around baseline  -GFR--> 24    Continue to monitor, Cr jumped to 2.55    Considering the patient has had increasing Cr with diuresis, the acute component of kidney injury is likely secondary to lasix and not CRS in the setting of exacerbation as her Cr did not improve with fluid removal    Pt shared that although she was on chlorthalidone 25 - held for past two months by nephro per pt    Plan:  -Avoid nephrotoxins  -Closely monitor   - started on lasix 40 twice per day by mouth - will d/c with this     2) Type 2 diabetes mellitus without long-term current use of insulin (CMS-hcc) (ICD-10: E11.9)  -CBGs are WNL  -HA1c from 12/2022--> 6.0,  -On glipizide 10 mg daily    Plan:  - stopped  ; glipizide on D/c due to AKI  - consider Jardiance when AKI is resolved  - PCP should consider jardiance in the setting of DM and CHF    3) Primary hypertension (ICD-10: I10)  -Blood pressures relatively controlled  -BP on presentation: (!) 163/66  -On labetalol 200 mg t.i.d. + nifedipine 90 mg    Plan:  -Continue home antihypertensive regimen, with a target SBP of <130.   - increased hydral to 100 three times per day - will likely d/c on this with plans to transition to ACE/ARB when AKI is resolved (looking for Cr back to about 2)  - consider imdur as well if her hypertension is resistant     4) Lymphedema of both lower extremities (ICD-10: I89.0)  -Hx BLE lymphedema  -Currently wrapped and not weeping    PLAN  -Continue outpatient follow-up @ lymphedema clinic    5) Chest pain (ICD-10: R07.9)  -P/w precordial chest pain  -ECG shows no overt schemic changes  -HEART score 5  -Chest pain resolved with diuresis, resumed while diuresis held    Plan:  - continue diuresis lasix 40 twice per day     6) Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CMS-hcc) (ICD-10: I50.33)  Echo 3/18 - EF 64%, PA pressure 52, grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild to mod AS  IVC was dilated    Exacerbation has been precipitated by elevated blood pressure while labetalol was being held for cardiac stress testing  Patient with prior diastolic dysfunction and also with known aortic stenosis valvular disease also contributing factor to failure    Plan:  Oral diuresis - lasix 40 twice per day - will d/c with this  Continued nifedipine and labetolol - consider switching from labtetolol as it is three times per day dosing at follow up   Started on hydral - consider imdur as well  Transition to ACE/ARB from hydralazine if able outpatient  Does not need entresto as she has HFpEF (rather than HFrEF)  Consider jardiance at PCP follow up when AKI resolves         Hospital Course:  Durrenda Onolemhemhen is a 78 y.o. female with a history  ; significant for HFpEF presenting with chest pain that radiates to the left arm.      In the ED, BNP elevated to 94, negative trops. She was admitted to obs for stress testing.      While on obs, labetolol was held in preparation for stress testing to rule out cardiogenic etiology of chest pain. The patient went into Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation and was unable to tolerate laying flat for stress testing - desat to 87%. Started on IV lasix, labetolol resumed. Admitted to B1 for management of Congestive Heart Failure exacerbation.      On arrival to B1, saturating well on 2L. Pt reports improvement in chest pain and leg swelling. IV diuresis continued and the patient was weaned off oxygen and orthopnea resolved. She developed an AKI so diuresis was held. Her course was complicated by urinary retention and she required straight cath that returned 450mL of urine. Oxybutynin, which she uses for hx of incontinence was held in the setting of retention. After her exacerbation was controlled, she received the MPI which demonstrated no perfusion defects. She retained overnight and then again during the day, foley placed with home nursing follow up and Uro appt one week after d/c for TOV.     To-Do:  Follow up with PCP within one week - need to follow up Cr and consider different agents for hypertension - would benefit from ACE/ARB and switching from three times per day medications  Consider coreg twice per day rather than labetolol three times per day  Consider Jardiance in the setting of Congestive Heart Failure and Type II DM  Follow up with Cardio - scheduled for 4/21/23  Uro follow up in one week for trial of void           Discharge Condition:  No orders of the defined types were placed in this encounter.
